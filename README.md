# Ecoswap pools

This project allow users to swap BEP20 tokens with my own created tokens with the implementation of liquidity pools. Smart contracts were clonned from [PancakeSwap](https://pancakeswap.finance/) (DEX on Binance Smat Chain) which originally use [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/). This project is running on **Binance Smart Chian Testnet** for proving about liquidity pool concepts and how it works.
